# Simple Manual Transmission Script for FiveM[Standalone]

## Overview

Making use of those flags that Rockstar put in a few updates ago

### Compatibility

This script is compatible with FiveM servers running build 3095 and higher.

## Features

- **Manual Transmission**: Players can toggle manual transmission to simulate manual gear shifting while driving vehicles.
- **Standalone**: You can even take out the chat message.
- **Configurability**: Look at how little code there is.

## Usage

1. Ensure that your server is running build 3095 or higher for compatibility.
2. Install the script on your FiveM server.
3. Players can toggle manual transmission mode by command or controller.
4. Once activated, the script will enable manual on every vehicle you enter and keep track of them via table.
5. Disabing it will restore your current car back to normal and clear the table of the rest.

## Credits

- Rockstar for allowing this.
